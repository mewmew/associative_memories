\subsection{Memory Resistor}

In 2008, a group of researchers from HP labs published a paper entitled \textit{``The missing memristor found''} \cite{hp_memristor_found}. What, then, is a memristor, and how did we know it was missing? A memristor (short for memory resistor) is a resistor with memory whose resistance depends on the past flows of current passed through the circuit. The resistance of a memristor is increased by current travelling through it in one direction, and decreased by current travelling through it in the other direction. A memristor is a passive circuit which remembers its resistance even when inactive and without power for long periods of time. These properties make memristors interesting candidates for non-volatile storage and memory units, as they retain their state when unpowered, and specifically as they enable storage of continuous ranges of values (i.e. low \textit{through} high resistance) in contrast to discrete binary values (i.e. 0 \textit{or} 1) \cite{memristors_a_new_frontier}.

Back in 1971, Leon Chua, often referred to as the father of non-linear circuit theory, laid the mathematical foundation detailing the relations between the four fundamental circuit elements. Interestingly, at that time only three fundamental circuit elements had physical counterparts, namely resistors, capacitors and inductors. The fourth fundamental circuit element, the memristor, was only conceptualized in theory by Chua for the sake of symmetry (see figure \ref{fig:circuit_elements}). As outlined in Chua's seminal paper \textit{``Memristor-the missing circuit element''} \cite{chua_memristor}, the current-$I$ voltage-$V$ curve of a memristor has a unique shape, an IV-fingerprint if you will, in the form of a pinched hysteresis loop (see figure \ref{fig:pinched_hysteresis}). A hysteresis loop indicates that a system has an internal state (i.e. memory) which affects the output of the system and which depends on past inputs to the system \cite{memristor_hayes}. As famously state by Chua, \textit{``If it's pinched it's a memristor''} indicates that the hysteresis loop of a memristor passes through the origin.

Ever since 2008, there has been an exponential increase in research related to memristors, where the number of search results for ``memristor'' on Google Scholar has doubled every 18-24 months \cite{memristors_a_new_frontier}. Why are so many researchers attracted to this new field, and what motivates such a profound investment of time and resources into this research?
