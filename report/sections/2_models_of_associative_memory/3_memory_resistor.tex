\subsection{Memory Resistor}

In 2008, a group of researchers from HP labs published a paper entitled \textit{``The missing memristor found''} \cite{hp_memristor_found}. What, then, is a memristor, and how did we know it was missing? A memristor (short for memory resistor) is a resistor with memory whose resistance depends on the past flows of current passed through the circuit. The resistance of a memristor is increased by current travelling through it in one direction, and decreased by current travelling through it in the other direction. A memristor is a passive circuit which remembers its resistance even when inactive and without power for long periods of time. These properties make memristors interesting candidates for non-volatile storage and memory units, as they retain their state when unpowered, and specifically as they enable storage of continuous ranges of values (i.e. low \textit{through} high resistance) in contrast to discrete binary values (i.e. 0 \textit{or} 1).

Back in 1971, Leon Chua, often referred to as the father of non-linear circuit theory, laid the mathematical foundation detailing the relations between the four fundamental circuit elements. Interestingly, at that time only three fundamental circuit elements had physical counterparts, namely resistors, capacitors and inductors. The fourth fundamental circuit element, the memristor, was only conceptualized in theory by Chua for the sake of symmetry (see figure \ref{fig:circuit_elements}). As outlined in Chua's seminal paper \textit{``Memristor-the missing circuit element''} \cite{chua_memristor}, the current-$I$ voltage-$V$ curve of a memristor has a unique shape, an IV-fingerprint if you will, in the form of a pinched hysteresis loop (see figure \ref{fig:pinched_hysteresis}). A hysteresis loop indicates that a system has an internal state (i.e. memory) which affects the output of the system and which depends on past inputs to the system \cite{memristor_hayes}. As famously state by Chua, \textit{``If it's pinched it's a memristor''} indicates that the hysteresis loop passes through the origin.

Ever since 2008, there has been an exponential increase in research related to memristors, where the number of search results for ``memristor'' on Google Scholar has doubled every 18-24 months \cite{memristors_a_new_frontier}. Why are so many researchers attracted to this new field, and what motivates such a profound investment of time and resources into this research?

\subsubsection{Artificial Synapses}

% TODO: Continue from here.

Several similarities have been identified between the properties of memristors and synapses, which make them interesting candidates for associative memory models; as further described in section \ref{sec:current_capabilities_memory_resistor}.

% Every modern computing system currently separates memory and processing. This works well for many tasks, but it fails for large-scale adaptive systems like brains or large ML models like neural networks. Indeed, there is no system in Nature outside of modern human digital computers that actually separates memory and processing, so it’s a wonder we have been able to do as much as we have.

%
% As a voltage (pressure) is applied to a memristor, its conductance will change.
%
% It is responsible for most self-organization on this planet. Nature is built of Knowms, including you.
%
% It is created when two energy dissipation pathways are competing for conduction resources. It appears to be at the heart of most self-organization.
%
% Knowm is built of a simple part repeated over and over again.
%
% When energy (for example water) flows through an adaptive container (for example dirt), the medium adapts or erodes in a particularly way that causes the energy to be dissipated faster. For example, the water erodes the ground and causes a channel to grow, which lowers the resistance to flow.
