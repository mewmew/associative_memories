% > Bejan (Construcal Law):
% > "For a finite-size system to persist in time (to live), it must evolve in such a way that it provides easier access to the imposed currents that flow through it."

% > Swenson:
% > "A system will select the path or assembly of paths out of available paths that minimizes the potential or maximizes the entropy at the fastest rate given the constraints."

% > England:
% > "Dissipation-driven adaptation of matter."
% >
% > E.g. The system will go with the flow, and it will maximize the flow.
% >
% > Maximize the dissipation of energy. The system will evolve in time towards that maximum, intrinsic repair.
% >
% > Have the system evolve itself to solve our problems.
