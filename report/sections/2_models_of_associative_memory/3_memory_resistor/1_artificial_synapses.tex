\subsubsection{Artificial Synapses}

% TODO: Continue from here.

Several similarities have been identified between the properties of memristors and synapses, which make them interesting candidates for associative memory models; as further described in section \ref{sec:current_capabilities_memory_resistor}.

% TODO: Merge the contents of the following input files into this file, when they have matured, and remove the respective input files.

% NOTE:
% * Key idea: memory access is adaptation is processing.

% NOTE:
% * distance between memory access and processing is 0 in the brain, which has a tremendous impact on the energy efficiency of highly adaptive systems.

% NOTE:
% * Points of bifurcation, forks in the road, branches. Two memristors. Difference in resistance determine the value of the synapse.
% * Energy dissipating pathways. Fractal patterns.

% NOTE:
% * Evolve to solve problem.
% * Self-organization.
% * The second law of theormodynamics state that ... maximize entropy, minimize energy

% NOTE:
% * The difference naturally goes towards 0. Give burst to reward and stay positive or negative.

% NOTE:
% * Neuron, a decision making thing.
% * Find decision boundry (i.e. representation of the weights w_0 and w_1).
% * Maximize classification margin; fight for classification margin by competing for conduction resources.

% NOTE:
% * Spike coding.
% * Can go backwards after training; (classification), to understand what groups of input contributed to the classification.
