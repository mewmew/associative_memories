\subsection{Memory Resistor}
\label{sec:current_capabilities_memory_resistor}

%Robin.

Proof of concept in 2010, using 3 neurons and 2 synapses to achieve 1 associative memory formation.

Artificial synapses experiment using memristors conducted in 2010, empirically validating the formation of associative memories using three neurons and two synapses \cite{memristor_conditioning}.
